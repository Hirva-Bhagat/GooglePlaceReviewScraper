Louis Nava,"I'm not enthusiastic about this place at all. It's super basic; I would give it a 3 star on the food but the price to quality ratio is dragging this one down to a 2 star rating.

Kyle Baxter,"Super fun and atmospheric. The food and treats are a step above the rest of the park. The rides are fun but the roller coaster is shockingly short. The shops are pretty great with really unique gifts and collectables. I do wish that some of the display shops were actually functional. Great experience, though.", 4 stars ,8 months ago

Pingping Weng,light show at Hogwarts in the evenin was amazing. I ride on the Harry Potter rides three times in a day! The evening one had a lot less people. So save time during the day if you are able to stay late. We stayed in the recreation hotel ‚Ä¶, 5 stars ,9 months ago

PanaderoBaker,"As a huge Harry Potter fan, I was surprisingly unimpressed. Maybe I just had really high expectations. There are only a few things to do and the rides are not great.

Nathan Fossell,It's a day in the world of Harry Potter. Get Your robes and butter beer and adventure off into honey dukes. Also give the pumpkin juice a try.
